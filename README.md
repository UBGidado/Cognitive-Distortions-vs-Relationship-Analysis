# Reproducibility Information

## Code

The code submitted for reproducibility of our results is anonymized and included in this supplementary material. The code is organized into the following notebooks, structured under a common directory `supplementary/`:

- `notebook_layer1.ipynb` – Contains code for [Layer 1 Name/Function, e.g., Preprocessing or Entity Extraction]
- `notebook_layer2.ipynb` – Implements [Layer 2, e.g., Role Labeling or Relation Tagging]
- `notebook_layer3.ipynb` – Implements [Layer 3, e.g., Post-processing or Visualization]

Each notebook is self-contained and includes explanations and outputs for reproducibility.

- `requirements.txt` – Lists the required Python packages and versions.
- `LICENSE` – States the open-source license used (MIT).
- `README.md` – This file, explaining the structure and usage.

All code is written in Python and was developed and tested on Google Colab with Python 3.11.13.

## How to Run

To reproduce the results:

1. Create a virtual environment or open a Colab notebook (https://colab.research.google.com).
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
